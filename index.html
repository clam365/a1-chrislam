    <h1>Information about Chris Lam</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm a creative web developer who is interning with Schneider Electric as their WebDev PM. I like to create things that tell people's story
      with authentic expression attached to it. Some of my hobbies include cooking, thrifting, watching anime, and exploring new places! Additionally, I'll be
      graduating this August after taking this class along with Computer Graphics!
